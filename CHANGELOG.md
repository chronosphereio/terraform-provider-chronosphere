# Releases

## Unreleased

Added:
 * Add unstable `otel_metrics_ingestion` resource.

Deprecated:
 * `proxy_url` is deprecated in alert receivers.
 * `chronosphere_mapping_rule.drop_timestamp` is deprecated.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug where `chronosphere_resource_pools_config` would not allow certain combinations
  of allocation percents due to float arithmetic not adding to exactly 100%. TF now relies
  on server-side validation of pools.

## v1.0.0

Initial public release for terraform-provider-chronosphere.
